Oh, well...

As I always mix these awful keys and forget which one to put where, here it is... A simple explanation about where each Wireguard key should go...

=== ON THE SERVER ===
In the server config file you put only the client keys in the [Peer] section:

[Peer]
PublicKey = client's public key
PresharedKey = preshared key - the same on server and client
AllowedIPs = Internal IP of the client inside the VPN

=== ON THE CLIENT ===
In the client config file you put:

[Interface]
PrivateKey = client's private key
Address = Internal IP address in the format IP.ADD.RE.SS/32

[Peer]
PublicKey = server public key
Endpoint = server IP:port
PresharedKey = the same as on the server
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0 or whatever routes you want

=== NOTE on CLIENT CONFIG ===
    [Interface] is the CLIENT
    [Peer] is the SERVER


It seems everytime the config is modified, a restart of wg-quick service is mandatory!
